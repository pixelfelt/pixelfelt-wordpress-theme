# Setup
- Install the [Impreza Theme](https://themeforest.net/item/impreza-retina-responsive-wordpress-theme/6434280)
- Install and activate this repository either manually, by [downloading and uploading the latest zip](https://github.com/pixelfelt/pixelfelt-wordpress-theme/archive/refs/heads/master.zip), or with automatic updates through git with [WP Pusher](https://wppusher.com/)
- Install and activate the Impreza Plugins: UpSolution Core, WPBakery, and Custom Post Type UI in Impreza by visiting `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=us-addons`
- Install [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/)
- Import Custom Post Type UI data from `./setup/custom-post-type-ui.json` into `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cptui_tools`
- Import Advanced Custom Fields data from `./setup/advanced-custom-fields.json` into `/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=acf-field-group&page=acf-tools`

## Local Development

I find it easiest to just [install Local by Flywheel](https://localwp.com/) and use it to automatically setup WordPress and dependencies (PHP, MySQL, etc)
